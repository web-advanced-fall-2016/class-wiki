#Repository Structure Setup/Remove Script
`setup.js` and `remove.js` are two simple script that will create directories for each of the classes as well as an individual branch for each student.

In order to setup the folders and branches, simply run the script from the root directory of the git repository:    
`node repo-setup-script/setup.js` OR `node repo-setup-script/remove.js`.
